<title>ALT-F Login Help Page</title>
</head><body>

<center><h2>Login Help</h2></center>

<p>You must authenticate in order to use the administrative pages,
otherwise you can only see the box status.

<p>Your login will be valid for one hour; if the box and your computer date and time are not correctly set, you will be logged-out as soon as you login.
To fix this issue, you have to telnet or ssh the box as the 'root' user and execute the command '<tt>echo "NONE-0" > /etc/TZ</tt>'. 

<p>In your first login to Alt-F you have to setup an administrative
password, and for confirmation you must type it twice.
The entered password will be the box administrative (the user 'root') password.
<p>Password can have ASCII letters, numbers and any character from the set <tt>!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt>.

<p>After login, the password can be reset at the <a href="sys_utils_hlp.html">System Utilities</a> web
page.

<p>You can change the 'root' user password using the command line 'passwd' command, having separate 'root' and web passwords, but if you latter change the web password the 'root' password will be overwritten.

<p>After your first login you must follow a first-time setup:

<ul>
	<li><a href="host_hlp.html">Setup->Host</a> where you can set the box name and its networking settings
	<li><a href="time_hlp.html">Setup->Time</a> where you can set your local timezone (where you live) and adjust the box RTC (Real Time Clock)
	<li><a href="diskwiz_hlp.html">Disk->Wizard</a> where you can partition and format all your disks or just keep their current state
	<li><a href="usersgroups_hlp.html">Setup->Users</a> where you must create the box users accounts
	<li><a href="settings_hlp.html">System->Settings->Save Settings</a> where you can save your settings in the box flash memory, making them persistent across reboots or poweroff.
</ul>
