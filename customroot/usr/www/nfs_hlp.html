<center><h2>NFS Setup Help</h2></center>

<strong>Delay NFS start on boot:</strong> NFS stores some client information on disk, for recovery on reboot
in case of server or client crash. That information is stored in a sub-directory where Alt-F 
packages are stored. At boot time, when NFS starts, the Alt-F directory might not yet be available
and such recovery information is missing.<br>Checking this checkbox delays the NFS start until the
Alt-F directory becomes available. Notice that if the checkbox is checked and the Alt-F directory
never appears, then NFS will not auto-start.
