September 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B4 released

What's new:

	-kernel 2.6.35.4
		-owners of A1 hardware boards should try this.
		-no lzma squashfs backported patch, as it turns the kernel
		unstable; as a result there are less 11MB of RAM available :-(
	-sftp and ftps support
	-ftp administering web page (AWP)
	-wget proxy AWP (untested)
	-disk wizard AWP
	-disk maintenance AWP redesigned, more disk/raid operations supported
	-disk partitioning AWP bugs fixed
	-remote web administration AWP (untested)
	-redesigned side menu and added drop-down menus on AWP
	-SMART AWP
	-Board revision level detection
	-several other fixes and improvements.

Known Issues:

	-Rev-A1 (try it an report) and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,
	 and cups does not noticies it, sending the print job to the printer,
	 which prints a black page, wasting all your cartridge ink.
	 After configure the printer in cups, DISCONECT THE PRINTER and print
	 a test page. If in the State column of cups jobs web page, or using
	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

	-big MTU (~>3712 bytes) cause a lot of "page allocation failure" error,
	 which impairs network performance (NFS at least)

	-nfs generates a lot of "received packet spanning multiple descriptors"
	 errors when MTU is not the same on both hosts!

	-partition sizes are not uniformly reported. Sometimes are binary based,
	 others decimal based.

	-component RAID disks hotpluging/ejecting might not do the right thing,
	 specially for raid0, JBD.

	-some web pages go back in browser history when an error is detected,
	 instead of reloading the previous page. The user must refresh the page

	-The Disk Partitioning web page is not able to re-partition disks whose
	 partitions that are not in increasing partition-start order, as the 
	 vendor's partition table are when configured for "standard disks".
	 This only happens if the user whish to keep some partition in the
	 middle of the disk unaltered. The solution is to re-partition the whole
	 disk, loosing all it data.
