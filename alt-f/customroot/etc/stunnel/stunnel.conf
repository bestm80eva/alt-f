; foreground = yes

; A copy of some devices and system files is needed within the chroot jail
; Chroot conflicts with configuration file reload and many other features
; chroot = /usr/var/lib/stunnel/
; Chroot jail can be escaped if setuid option is not used
; setuid = nobody
; setgid = nobody

; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /var/run/stunnel.pid

; Debugging stuff (may useful for troubleshooting)
debug = 0
;output = stunnel.log

; * Service Defaults (may also be specified in individual service sections)   *
; *****************************************************************************

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
;key = /usr/etc/stunnel/mail.pem

; Authentication stuff needs to be configured to prevent MITM attacks
; It is not enabled by default!
; verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/ssl/cert.pem
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively CRLfile can be used
;CRLfile = /etc/ssl/cert.pem

; Disable support for insecure SSLv2 protocol
options = NO_SSLv2
; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; The following options provide additional security at some performance penalty
; Default ECDH/DH parameters are strong/conservative, so it is quite safe to
; comment out these lines in order to get a performance boost
; options = SINGLE_ECDH_USE
; options = SINGLE_DH_USE
