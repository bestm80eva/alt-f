<center><h2>DHCP/DNS Setup Help</h2></center>

<p> Every computer in a network must have an assigned IP. An IP has the
form x.x.x.x, where x lies between 1 and 254.<br>

It is also convenient to assign a name to a computer, in order to not
have to remember its IP when one desires to communicate with it. </p>

<p> Computers can have static or dynamically assigned IP, where its IP
is not fixed but assigned on-demand by a DHCP server (Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol). Usually the DHCP server lies in the
modem/router that connects you to the internet, but Alt-F also has a
DHCP server, that you can configure in this page.<br>

</p>

<p> No two DHCP servers should be running in the same network. If using
Alt-F DHCP server, remember to stop the modem/router DHCP server. </p>

<p>A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates computer names to IP.<br>

When you type a web address on your browser, that name has to be
translated to an IP in order to establish communications with the
computer that hosts the web pages you wish to visit.<br>
 Usually it is your modem/router that takes
that role, either by returning the IP associated with the computer name,
or by forwarding the request to another DNS server, usually your ISP DNS
server. </p>

<p> Alt-F combined DHCP/DNS server, dnsmasq, can replace yours router's
DHCP/DNS server, with the advantage that it also translates your local
network computer names.<br>

When you connect your laptop (that usually uses DHCP) to your local
network, it  asks for an IP and gives its own name; Alt-F DHCP/DNS
server replies giving it an yet unassigned IP, but only for a certain
amount of time (the lease time), and takes note of the computer
name.<br>

When later your refer to your computer name in a browser, the DHCP/DNS
server reply with the IP that it leased. </p>

<p> Sometime you wish to have a device in your network to have a know
IP, but want it to be dynamically assigned.<br>

As every network card in the world has a unique identifier, its MAC,
this can also be done by the Alt-F DHCP/DNS server.<br>

You only have to specify the computer name, its MAC, and the desired IP.
If you don't know the computer MAC, you can ask Alt-F to discover it by
using the IP currently assigned to the computer. </p>

<p> Not all computers in your local network have dynamically assigned
IP, some use fixed IP. Your modem/router, as an example, has a fixed IP;
generally all devices in a network with a server role have static
IP.<br>

The association of computer names to its fixed IP is done through the
Setup->Hosts page.<br>

 Alt-F DHCP/DNS server also uses that information when asked to
translate a name to an IP. </p>

<p>When furnishing an IP, a DHCP server also advertises other resources
in the network, such as the modem/router IP, the DNS server, time
servers, the domain name, etc. That information is collected from
elsewhere from a variety of configuration files. </p>

<ul>

<li>In  <strong>Dynamically serve IPs</strong> you can specify the range
of IP that you wish the DHCP server to server, and for how long it is
valid; after that time elapses, the computer has to ask for an IP again,
renewing the lease.

<li>In <strong>Serve fixed IPs based on MAC</strong>, you can specify
the name and MAC of a computer, and its the desired IP, as well as the
time for which it is valid when leased.

<li>In <strong>Current Leases</strong> you can see the names, IP and MAC
of computers currently being  served, as well as the lease time expiry
date.<br>

Notice that when you disconnect a computer, the lease does not
disappears immediately, only after the lease expiry time has elapsed.
This is the desired behavior.

<li>In <strong>Time Servers</strong> you can specify if you wish the
DHCP/DNS server to advertise a local time server (configurable through
the Services->Network->ntp web page), or another time server.

<li>In <strong>TFTP server</strong> you can enable and advertise a
builtin TFTP server, and specify the directory that it will serve.<br>

A TFTP server serves files using a special protocol, it is a dnsmasq
add-on but is out of the scope of a DHCP/DNS server.

<li>In <strong>Logging</strong> you can enable a more verbose DHCP log
and also DNS queries. The logs can be seen, mixed with other logs, using
the System->Utilities->System logs web page.
