<h2><center>Status Page Help</center></h2>

<p>This page is self-explanatory. It will refresh itself every 15 seconds, and leaving
it alone will avoid the disks to spin down. If however the disks are already spindown
they will not spinup when the page is displayed.<p>

<p>Items deserving an explanation:

<ul>

<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: is the box internal temperature. It will be affected by ambient temperature
and by disks temperature.

<li><strong>Fan speed</strong>: the current fan speed (for A1 and B1 boards, fake to C1 boards).
The fan speed is automaticaly adjusted according to the box temperature.

<li><strong>Load</strong>: The number of processes trying to execute simultaneously on the CPU.

<li><strong>Swap</strong>: amount of disk space used as memory; when the system needs more memory than physical
memory is available, a special disk partition called swap is used ans some less frequently
used applications and data are moved to the disk.

<li><strong>MTU</strong>: also called "jumbo frames"; they can improve network throughtput when transfering
large files, but both sides of the transfer must support it.<br>
Try to use values lower than 3700 bytes and/or 7500 bytes.<bt>
Changing it right after powerup is fine, but changing it when the system has already beeing
active for a some time can actually degrade network performance.

<li><strong>Health</strong>: the disk health, as reported by SMART.<br>
If you see a message in red, replace the disk as soon as possible, as the disk is likely
to fail in the next hours or days.<br>
If the message appears in blue it means that some disk parameter has failed in the past.

<li><strong>Dirty</strong>: the filesystem is in an inconsistent state, you should go to
 Disk->Filesystem->FS Operation and selecte "clean". "ext2" filesystems are marked as dirty
as soon as they are mounted.

<li><strong>Mode</strong>: can be RW or RO. If the system finds a filesystem dirty at powerup or hotplugging,
and can't clean it, the filesystem will be mounted in Read Only mode, otherwise it will
be mounted as Read Write.

<li><strong>Automatic FSCK in</strong>: the number of mounts or days left until an automatic
 filesystem check will be done at powerup or mount time.<br>
To avoid an inoportune lenghly check, that will certainly happen when you most need your files,
you should manualy start a filesystem check using<br>
Disk->Filesystems->Operation->Clean

</ul>
