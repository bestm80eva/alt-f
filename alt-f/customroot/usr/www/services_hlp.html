<center><h2>Services Help</h2></center>

<p>Alt-F has three kinds of services, Network, System and User services, all with the same interface.
<p>A service consists of one or more programs that run constantly, or at regular time intervals,
and that provides a well defined set of functionalities.

<p>In this page you can see the name, description and current status of each service,
either running or stopped, and you can start or stop each one of them; most services can
also be configured throught its own web page.<br>
You can also configure a service to be automatically started at boot time by checking the
"Boot Enabled" checkbox and Submiting; however, for safety or other reasons,
certain services can't be boot disabled.

<p>Some Alt-F packages provide aditional services, and after installing them the new service will
appear in one of the Services pages.
