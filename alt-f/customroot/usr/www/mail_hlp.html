<center><h2>Mail Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can setup a mail server and mail recipient where you want Alt-F to send warnings.

<p>You have to specify in "Server Name" and "Server Port" the name and port of the mail server that will accept e-mails sent from the box, which by default is set to GMail.<br>
The server port depends on the protocol/server used; by default it is set to the port used by GMail for secure transmission.<br>
You must check the "TLS/SSL" checkbutton if you want to use a secure TLS or SSL channel.

<p>If the specified mail server does not requires authentication, check the "Anonymous" checkbox, otherwise fill-in your username and password for the server.

<p>Password can have ASCII letters, numbers and any character from the set <tt>!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt>.

<p>Fill-in the warning recipient e-mail address in the "Send To" field and hit the "Test" button to send a test e-mail.
