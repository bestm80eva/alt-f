<center><h2>New User Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>You must create a user for each person that is going to use the box to store their files. See also <a href="perms_hlp.html">Directory Owner and Group and Access Permissions</a> and <a href="usersgroups_hlp.html">Users and Groups</a>

<p>You should input the user name in the "Full name" input field, such as "John Smith"; a directory named "John Smith" will be created for this user usage in the "Users" directory.<br>
The "Users" directory was created in the filesystem that you specified when you created the box first user.<br>
This name will be used to validade this user when connecting from or to MS-Windows, so it should be the same name that the user already has on MS-Windows computers.

<p>In linux, the user name can't have spaces on it, and a nick name should be input in the "Nick name" field, such as "jsmith".<br>
For convenience this nick name should be the same that the user has on other unix-like computers, as it will be used to validate the user on such computers.

<p>You should also specify the user password in the "Password" field and repeat it in the "Again" field, to make sure that there are no mistakes.<br>
Password can have ASCII letters, numbers and any character from the set <tt>!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt>.<br>
This password will be used to validade the user on MS-Windows and Unix-like computers.

<p>In linux an user has an "User ID" and a "Group ID", that should be entered in the respective input fields if the default shown values are not convenient.<br>
This has only significance if the user is going to use NFS for sharing files in several computers, as in NFS-v3 user equivalence is done by their user and group ids.
