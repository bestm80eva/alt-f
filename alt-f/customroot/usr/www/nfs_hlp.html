<center><h2>NFS Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can configure NFS, allowing UNIX computers to access
this box shares, and to make available to the box existing shares in other
UNIX computers.<br>

A share is a network offer of an existing folder.

<ul>
<li><h4>Folders to export to other hosts</h4>
Specifies folders that can be NFS mounted by other computers. Only NFS-v3 is supported.

<ul>
<li><strong>Disable:</strong> Check to temporary stop exporting the share.</li>

<li><strong>Folder:</strong> The folder to export.
<strong>Note:</strong> To export the same folder to different hosts with
different options, enter the same folder on different lines for each host.</li>

<li><strong>Search:</strong> Hit to browse the local folder structure. 
Hitting "OK" will fill-in the Folder field. </li>

<li><strong>Allowed hosts:</strong> the hosts allowed to mount the share. Can be:
<ul>
<li>anonymous: a single * character will match all clients.</li>
<li>single host: a host name setup under Setup->Hosts, or an IP address</li>
<li>IP networks: a (sub) network specified by address/netmask</li>
<li>wildcards: wildcard characters * and ?, or class lists within [square brackets]. </li>
<li>netgroups: NIS  netgroups  may be given as @group (not supported)</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Export Options:</strong> Any NFS allowed option, comma separated, no spaces.</li>

<li><strong>Options:</strong> Opens a new window with a list of the most
frequently used options and the currently selected ones; hit CTRL while
clicking to select multiple options. Options of the form option=value
does not preserve the current value. </li>

</ul></li>

<li><h4>Folders to import from other hosts</h4>

Specify remote folders to be locally mounted, e.g. to make them available under other protocol.
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable:</strong> Check to temporary stop mounting the share..</li>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> The remote hostname (or IP address) that exports the share.</li>
<li><strong>Folder:</strong> The remote folder to mount locally.</li>
<li><strong>Discover:</strong> Hit to NFS browse the network; hitting a line will fill the Host and Folder fields.</li>
<li><strong>Local Folder:</strong> Local folder where the remote share should be made available. 
It is recommended to use an empty folder directly under "/mnt"; if necessary create the folder, e.g. "/mnt/remoteNFS".</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> Hit to browse the local folder structure (and possibly create the mount folder).</li>
<li><strong>Mount Options:</strong> NFS mount options, comma separated, no spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Options:</strong> Opens a new window with a list of the most
frequently used mount options and the currently selected ones; hit CTRL while
clicking to select multiple options. Options of the form option=value
does not preserve the current value. 

After an entry is filled-in and the Submit button is hit, a
<strong>Mount</strong> button will appear, which will make the remote
share locally available; when <em>mounted</em>, an
<strong>unMount</strong> button will appear instead, which if selected will unmount
(unmap) the remote share. </li>

</ul></li>

<li><p><h4>Delay NFS start on boot:</h4> NFS stores some client information on disk, for recovery on reboot
in case of server or client crash. That information is stored in a sub-directory where Alt-F 
packages are stored. At boot time, when NFS starts, the Alt-F directory might not yet be available
and such recovery information is missing.<br>Checking this checkbox delays the NFS start until the
Alt-F directory becomes available. Notice that if the checkbox is checked and the Alt-F directory
never appears, then NFS will not auto-start.</li>

</ul>
