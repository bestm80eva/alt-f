<center><h2>Samba Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can configure Samba, allowing MS-Windows computers
to access this box shares, and to make available to the box shares defined in
other computers.<br>
 
A share is a network offer of an existing folder.

<ul>
<li><h4>Host details</h4>
You might configure how the box appears in the MS-Windows network browser:

<ul>
<li><strong>Host name</strong> - the network name used to access the box.</li>
<li><strong>Host description</strong> - the box description.</li>
<li><strong>Workgroup</strong> - the MS-Windows workgroup the box will belong to.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h4>Folders to export to other hosts</h4>
You can create shares to be accessed from other computers, one per line:

<ul>
<li><strong>Disable</strong> - fast way to enable or disable a share.</li>

<li><strong>Folder</strong> - local folder name that will be offered as a share.<br>
If empty, the share (not the folder!) will be removed when the Submit button is hit.</li>

<li><strong>Browse</strong> - opens the <em>Folders Browse</em> window,
which allows selecting an existing folder (or creating a new one).<br>
The selected folder will automatically fill-in the previous
<strong>Folder</strong> entry field.</li>

<li><strong>Share Name </strong> - the name of the offered share; if empty
the folder name will be used.</li>

<li><strong>Comment</strong> - text that will appear in the MS-Windows
explorer near the share name; if empty the folder name will be used.</li>

<li><strong>Allow</strong> - selects who can access the share.<br> Notice
that Samba will not override the filesystem folder permissions, i.e.,
the folder associated with a share also has to have the right
permissions (Setup->Folders->Permissions, or just use the Browse button).<br>

The Users and Public shares and folders, which are automatically created
when the first user is created, have the correct permissions for the
intended usage, use them as a pattern.<br>

For further details read the "Folder Ownership and Access Permissions"
<a href="perms_hlp.html">online</a> help.</li>

<ul>
<li>anybody: everybody can access the share, even anonymous or guest users.</li>

<li>nonpublic: reserved for the Users home folder.<br>
Each user's Home folder can only be accessed by themself when they are authenticated.</li>

<li>user: only the specified user will be able to access the share.</li>
<li>+group: only members of the specified group will be able to access the share.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Browsable</strong> - the share is browsable.</li>
<li><strong>Read Only</strong> - no writing is allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Inherit Perms</strong> - created files or folders inherit the
base folder ownership and permissions.</li>

</ul>

<li><h4>Folders to import from other hosts</h4>
You can make other computer shares available to the box.<br>

After an entry is filled-in and the Submit button is hit, a
<strong>Mount</strong> button will appear, which will make the remote
share locally available; when <em>mounted</em>, an
<strong>unMount</strong> button will appear instead, which if selected will unmount
(unmap) the remote share. 

<ul>

<li><strong>Host</strong> - the computer name where the share is available.<br>
If empty, the whole entry will be removed when the Submit button is hit.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong> - the remote share name.<br>
If empty, the whole entry will be removed when the Submit button is hit.</li>

<li><strong>Discover</strong> - opens a new window and performs a SMB/CIFS
network scan, showing the existing computers and offered shares;
clicking a share will fill-in the previous <strong>Host</strong> and
<strong>Share</strong> entry fields.</li>

<li><strong>Local Folder</strong> - the local folder where the remote
share contents will be available.<br> If the folder is not empty, its contents
will (temporarily) disappear while the remote share is mounted, and will
reappear when the remote share is unmounted.</li>

<li><strong>Search</strong> - opens the <em>Folders Browse</em> window, which will
fill-in the Local Folder entry field with the selected folder.</li>

<li><strong>Mount Options</strong> - specify the desired mount options;
the default values will generally be OK.</li>

</ul></li>

<li><h4>Advanced Button</h4> allows using SWAT, the
<em>Samba Web Administration Tool</em>, which opens a new window after
asking for the <em>root</em> credentials.<br> SWAT allows a Samba
administrator to configure the complex <tt>smb.conf</tt> file, producing
a configuration file that will not be fully recognized by the Alt-F
webUI; you should thus use either SWAT or the Alt-F Samba webUI to
configure Samba.<br> If you install the <tt>samba-doc</tt> Alt-F package
you can then use the SWAT online help facilities.</li>

</ul>
