<center><h2>Users and Groups Setup Help</h2></center>

Users and Groups (of users) are a key concept in administering and using Linux.<br>
Files and directories belong to an user, and even processes (running programs) run on behalf of a user, see <a href="perms_hlp.html">Directory Owner and Group and Access Permissions</a> and <a href="newuser_hlp.html">New User Setup</a> for further info.<br>

<p>In this page you can create new users and groups and assign users to one or more groups.

<p>In the left section, <strong>Users</strong>, you have a list of the existing users, and selecting one of them you can see to what groups he belongs to.<br>
You can also create a new user, change its password or delete it.<br>
To create a new user fill his name in the <strong>User Name</strong> field (or clear it) first. When a new user is created it will belong by default to the <em>users</em> group and a directory, named after his name, will be created for him; this directory is its <em>home directory</em>, and only him (and the <em>root</em> user) has permissions to access it.<br>
Deleting a user does not delete his home directory if it is not empty.<br>

<p>In the right section, <strong>Groups</strong>, you have a list of the existing groups, and selecting one of them you can see what users belong to it.<br>
You can also create a new group, filling its name in the <strong>Group Name</strong> field, or delete an existing group if it is not the main group of an existing user.<br>

<p>In the lower section, <strong>Users and Groups</strong>, you can add or delete a selected user to or from a selected group.
