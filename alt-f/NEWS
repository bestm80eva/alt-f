=== March 23, 2013: Alt-F-0.1RC3 is released

One year after 0.1RC2 and three years after 0.1B1, I'm pleased to announce 0.1RC3.
This will be the last release before the final 1.0.

This release has many bug fixes, some improvements and a few new things

Use https://sourceforge.net/projects/alt-f to download it

-Before upgrading to RC3, remove the stunnel package, now part of the
 base firmware, as well as all packages that overrides the base firmware
 in RC2, such as samba, samba-extra, vsftp, gptfdisk...

-After upgrading to RC3, and if you are using DHCP, then use Setup->Host
 to update the configuration for new DHCP features (always request the
 same IP and supply the current host name to the DHCP server)   

After one year I just don't remember all made changes. The most recent and noteworth:

-The DNS-321 is now supported, thanks to Matt Hayden.
 Instead of flashing Alt-F, you can try first to use the "reloaded" method (untested).

-There is firmware available for the Conceptronics-CH3SNAS and the
 Fujitsu-Siemens DUO35LR, ready to be flashed using the boxes Firmware
 Upgrade pages. 

-The linux kernel is now compiled for execution speed instead of space saving.

-When Alt-F is flashed, the root filesystem runs directly from flash
 memory, saving 6.5MB of memory (a 10% saving!)

-Ethtool has been removed from the base firmware and is now an independent package.

-The Folder Browser now can rename folders, has a faster Flat View mode,
 supports non western languages, and has a progress meter for the copy
 and move operations.

-The Status page shows the box hardware Backup and fsck errors, and the box  

-A few Backups fixes, creating log files that shows on the Status Page on error

-SWAT is not embedded in frames anymore (security http://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2013-0213)

-Some fixes to the Alt-F and ffp Package Manager pages

-The ffp Package Manager now supports installing both ffp-0.5 and ffp-0.7

-Bookmarking now works for embedded pages

-stunnel is now part of the base firmware, meaning that secure http is
 now available of the shelf for the administrative web pages (including SWAT)

-The httpd configuration web page now allows selecting between port 80 or 8080 for the
 administrative web server for http, or between ports 443 or 8443 for https, so the default
 80 and 443 port will be keep free for usage with the lighttpd server.

=== February 21, 2012: Alt-F-0.1RC2 is released

-All packages in the base firmware updated to the last version (but e2fsprogs and samba,
which is now at version 3.5.12; samba-3.6.3 and e2fsprogs-1.42 just don't fit
the available flash space)

This package update has subverted the Release Candidate (RC) concept,
and although care has been taken, there might exists incompatibility
with some RC1 configuration files. New users should have no problems.
No update fix script will be made available.

-Most bugs and feature requests fixed
-Most web pages are now W3c Validator compliant
-Ability to bookmark frequently accessed web pages
-New rsyncd setup web page
-New crontab setup web page
-Preliminary LVM setup web page (don't use in production!)
-Improved cryptsetup web page
-Improved mail setup web page
-Improved samba setup web page
-Restore RAID behaviour of 0.1B7
-IPv6 moved to the kernel-modules packages
-Obsolete/Updated/new disk-instalable packages (more to follow after this release):

	netatalk-2.1.6 is not supported anymore, upgrade to netatalk2.
	netatalk-2.2.2
	transmission-2.42
	fuppes-660 is back
	minidlna-1.024	
	automatic-0.7.2
	cryptsetup-1.4.1
	bridge-1.5
	pcre-8.20
	cryptodev-linux-1.0 (for hardware accelerated crypto engine)
	kernel-modules has now more drivers available

User who have an already Alt-F flashed box should use the TryIt button 
in the Firmware Upgrader web page before flashing this new version. 
Users that are using a reloaded Alt-F can proceed as above first, in order 
to try the new version without messing up with the fun_plug installation. 

=== October 13, 2011: Alt-F-0.1RC1 is released

-Alt-F can now be directly flashed using the vendor's firmware, no need for fun_plug
 (tested with D-Link firmware 1.09 on a rev-B1 hardware box)

-Support for greater then 2.2TB disks (with UEFI GPT partitioning)
 Disk Partitioner and Disk Wizard support
 Conversion from MBR to GPT and vice-versa

-Secure (https) web pages through the optional package 'stunnel'
 Both http and https are active (swat uses port 902 for https) 

-The Backup Service can now backup remote hosts using ftp/http/smb/nfs/rsync/rsyncd.
 It can even wakeup the remote host at backup time if the remote host is configured
 to be awaked-up by a network magic packet, WOL.
 Files greater than 4.2GB are not supported.

-Debian now installs into and runs from RAID

-More online-help pages

-uClibc changes for Optware compatibility. However, most Optware packages are still not usable.
 Due to the uClibc change, the recommended procedure is to update all packages 
 after upgrading to RC1 (the Alt-F_B7_to_RC1.fix script does this)

-updated packages: samba, netatalk, forked-daapd, transmission, avahi,
 cups, mdadm, rsync, smartmontools, wget, openssh, ffmpeg, hplip,
 libcurl, libpcap, libxml2, lzo, dnsmasq, dropbear, libiconv,
 msmtp, nfs-utils, ntp, netsnmp, libgcrypt,
 libgpg-error, libpcre, popt,

-samba-3.5.9 update asks for configuration file editing,
 adding "passdb backend = smbpasswd" to the Global section
 (the Alt-F_B7_to_RC1.fix script does this)
 
-Thanks to samba, now using 1/3 of flash space! the base firmware had to be compiled for
 flash memory space saving, not execution speed :-(
 -disk-installable packages are still compiled for execution speed

-new packages: gptfdisk, openvpn, cryptsetup, lvm2, iscsitarget, nut, parted,
 nmap, sysstat, bonnie++, ntfs-3g_ntfsprogs, stunnel, 

-cryptsetup initial support adds capability to LUKS format a physical partition.
 -No checks are done to see if the partition is currently in use
 -remember dm-crypt/LUKS is 3 to 4 times slower than a non encrypted partition!
 -there are some problems identifying and handling devices, cryptsetup fault,
  as it generates lots of (unnecessary?) device add/remove kernel events.

-LVM initial support, scan volume groups and and mounts physical volumes
 no web interface to create and manage them.

-LVM and cryptsetup might interfere Disk Partitioner.
 You might have to stop them manually if problems arise. 

=== March 26, 2011: Alt-F-0.1B7 is released on Alt-F first anniversary

	In the previous 12 months Alt-F has seen 6 releases, which gives an average of
	a new release every 2 months.

	During the previous year, thanks to many user reports and suggestions,
	and to many bug-fixes and improvements, Alt-F has evolved in a way that
	means that it is now mature and ready to leave the Beta status, what
	will hopefully happens in the next release.

	Online documentation, Wiki entries, packages updates and bug fixes will be the priority
	for the next release.

	Alt-F is intended to be a serious and sustainable alternative to the vendor's firmware,
	ready to be used by the average user through its administering web pages.

	Enjoy

The old feed is still available under the name unstable-old 
The experimental feed was deleted. 

=== December 20, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B6 Released

What's new:
	-kernel 2.6.36.2, nfs-utils back to version 1.2.1
	-terse report from vaughnd12 confirms that rev-A1 boards are now working.
	 (tanks to Philster76 and KRH for initial testing)
	-partitioning and filesystem web pages spliced and RAID web page created
	-Filesystems, RAID, and Partitioner web pages are now simpler
	-Disk Partitioner and Wizard now unconditionally aligns partitions on 4K boundaries
	-Disk Partitioner now has an advanced mode
	-Directory Browser web page with enhanced (but slow) browsing and
	 with directory copy/cut/move/create/delete capabilities
	-Directory Ownership and Access Permissions web page
	-backup support and Backup Manager administering web pages (preliminary)
	 backups local directories and directories mounted by NFS/CIFS
	-Remote syslog support and administering web pages (contribution from Augusto Bott)
	-Firmware updater web page now enables recovering original vendor's settings from backup
	 (untested if effective, there are some differences between backup and original)
	-Status web page only shows what exists
	-Spaces allowed in paths in /etc/fstab and /etc/exports (use\040as\040space)
	 and processed by smb and nfs web pages. NFS complains but works.
	 mounts by filesystem labels still replace spaces with underscores.
	-Speed improvement in web pages that deals with disk
	-Countless improvements and bug fixes.

	-Users with an Alt-F flashed box should use the *TryIt* option in the Firmware
	 Updater web page before actually flashing it, as incompatibilities might happen.
	 Its Beta!

	-There are a few identified incompatibilities between B5 and B6. If you have only slightly
	changed settings, the recomended procedure is to clear settings before starting using.
	If you dont' want to clean settings, the file Alt-F_B5_to_B6.fix script tryies to fixes them.
	Before using or flashing Alt-F-01.B6, telnet/ssh the box, and execute the script.
	After doing it don't save settings until start using B6. Other incompatibilities might arise.

	I will now start updating disk-instalable packages and fix 0.1B6 reported bugs.
	No more features are expected in the base firmware, but (micro)emacs and ncurses
	will be removed and turned into packages.

	Hopefully the next release will be 0.1

=== October 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B5 released

What's new:

	-finally works with 100Mbps and 1Gbps switches or routers
	-support for rev-C1 boards through backported 2.6.36 patch

	-kernel 2.6.35.7, nfs-utils 1.2.3, kexec to 2.0.2, 
	-No job is finished until the paperwork is done:
	 	-descriptive help support with some help pages already written
		-tooltip support with demos in some pages
	-disaster recovery:
		-no password asked when connecting through the serial port
		-back button opens telnet without password on port 26, or clears flash

=== September 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B4 released

What's new:

	-kernel 2.6.35.4
		-owners of A1 hardware boards should try this.
		-no lzma squashfs backported patch, as it turns the kernel
		unstable; as a result there are less 11MB of RAM available :-(
	-sftp and ftps support
	-ftp administering web page (AWP)
	-wget proxy AWP (untested)
	-disk wizard AWP

	-Board revision level detection
	-several other fixes and improvements.

Known Issues:

	-Rev-A1 (try it an report) and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,
	 and cups does not notices it, sending the print job to the printer,
	 which prints a black page, wasting all your cartridge ink.
	 After configure the printer in cups, DISCONNECT THE PRINTER and print
	 a test page. If in the State column of cups jobs web page, or using
	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

=== July 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B3 released

-What's new:

	-Kernel, libraries and apps compiled for execution speed instead of
	space saving (as a result, and because of lack of flash memory space,
	uShare and Transmission are now packages)
	-kernel 2.6.33.6
	-Filesystem Maintenance web page
	-Disk Partition/RAID creation web page
	-improved DHCP support
	-improved fun_plug for ffp users
	-improved Alt-F packages installation and administration

-Available packages:
    -end-user packages with web administration page:
        -Transmission, Fuppes, MediaTomb, miniDLNA, uShare, Firefly,
	 cups, hplip, samba-doc, 
    -command-line tools:
        -dev-bundle, file, lsof, make, strace, nano, usbutils, unrar 
        -mplayer, lame, ffmpeg, sane
    -networking:
        -avahi, netatalk (both untested)
    -filesystems:
		-ntfsprogs
    -databases:
        -sqlite, bdb, gdbm, 
    -support libraries and tools:

	libogg, libpng, libtheora, libupnp, libusb, libvorbis, libxml2,
	readline, taglib, tiff, pcre

-Known Issues:
	-Rev-A1 and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,
	 and cups does not notices it, sending the print job to the printer,
	 which prints a black page, wasting all your cartridge ink.
	 After configure the printer in cups, DISCONNECT THE PRINTER and print
	 a test page. If in the State column of cups jobs web page, or using
	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

	-big MTU (~>3712 bytes) cause a lot of "page allocation failure" error,
	 which impairs network performance (NFS at least)

	-nfs generates a lot of "received packet spanning multiple descriptors"
	 errors when MTU is not the same on both hosts!

	-partition sizes are not uniformly reported. Sometimes are binary based,
	 others decimal based.

	-component RAID disks hotpluging/ejecting might not do the right thing,
	 specially for raid0, JBD.

	-some web pages go back in browser history when an error is detected,
	 instead of reloading the previous page. The user must refresh the page

	-The Disk Partitioning web page is not able to re-partition disks whose
	 partitions that are not in increasing partition-start order, as the 
	 vendor's partition table are when configured for "standard disks".
	 This only happens if the user whish to keep some partition in the
	 middle of the disk unaltered. The solution is to re-partition the whole
	 disk, loosing all it data.

=== April 23 2010: Alt-F-0.1B2 released

What's new:

	-NFS setup web page done. 
	-Native package manager based on ipkg, and administering web page. 
	-Added a temporary and experimental package feed with some packages 
	 available (some of them were not even tested) 
	-Fixed fun_plug 

=== March 26, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B1 released
