December 20, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B6 Released

What's new:
	-kernel 2.6.36.2, nfs-utils back to version 1.2.1
	-terse report from vaughnd12 confirms that rev-A1 boards are now working.
	 (tanks to Philster76 and KRH for initial testing)
	-partitioning and filesystem web pages spliced and RAID web page created
	-Filesystems, RAID, and Partitioner web pages are now simpler
	-Disk Partitioner and Wizard now unconditionally aligns partitions on 4K boundaries
	-Disk Partitioner now has an advanced mode
	-Directory Browser web page with enhanced (but slow) browsing and
	 with directory copy/cut/move/create/delete capabilities
	-Directory Ownership and Access Permissions web page
	-backup support and Backup Manager administering web pages (preliminary)
	 backups local directories and directories mounted by NFS/CIFS
	-Remote syslog support and administering web pages (contribution from Augusto Bott)
	-Firmware updater web page now enables recovering original vendor's settings from backup
	 (untested if effective, there are some differences between backup and original)
	-Status web page only shows what exists
	-Spaces allowed in paths in /etc/fstab and /etc/exports (use\040as\040space)
	 and processed by smb and nfs web pages. NFS complains but works.
	 mounts by filesystem labels still replace spaces with underscores.
	-Speed improvement in web pages that deals with disk
	-Countless improvements and bug fixes.

-Users with an Alt-F flashed box should use the *TryIt* option in the Firmware Updater
 web page before actually flashing it, as incompatibilities might happen. Its Beta!

-There are a few identified incompatibilities between B5 and B6. If you have only slightly
 changed settings, the recomended procedure is to clear settings before starting using.
 If you dont' want to clean settings, the file Alt-F_B5_to_B6.fix script tryies to fixes them.
 Before using or flashing Alt-F-01.B6, telnet/ssh the box, and execute the script.
 After doing it don't save settings until start using B6. Other incompatibilities might arise.

I will now start updating disk-instalable packages and fix 0.1B6 reported bugs.
No more features are expected in the base firmware, but (micro)emacs and ncurses
will be removed and turned into packages.

Hopefully the next release will be 0.1

September 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B4 released

What's new:

	-kernel 2.6.35.4
		-owners of A1 hardware boards should try this.
		-no lzma squashfs backported patch, as it turns the kernel
		unstable; as a result there are less 11MB of RAM available :-(
	-sftp and ftps support
	-ftp administering web page (AWP)
	-wget proxy AWP (untested)
	-disk wizard AWP
	-disk maintenance AWP redesigned, more disk/raid operations supported
	-disk partitioning AWP bugs fixed
	-remote web administration AWP (untested)
	-redesigned side menu and added drop-down menus on AWP
	-SMART AWP
	-Board revision level detection
	-several other fixes and improvements.

Known Issues:

	-Rev-A1 (try it an report) and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,
	 and cups does not notices it, sending the print job to the printer,
	 which prints a black page, wasting all your cartridge ink.
	 After configure the printer in cups, DISCONNECT THE PRINTER and print
	 a test page. If in the State column of cups jobs web page, or using
	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

July, 22, 2010: Alt-F-0.1B3 released

Known Issues:
	-Rev-A1 and rev-C1 hardware boards not yet supported

	-network link auto-negotiation doesn't work. As result Alt-F
	 only works when the box is connected to Gbit switches/routers
	 or network cards. 100/10Mbps switch or routers won't work.

	-ghostscrip/hplip can fail with an "Unable to get scanline 0/1" error,

	 "lpstat -p" you see a  "Unable to get scanline 0/1" message,
	 CANCEL THE PRINT JOB AND DON'T USE THAT PRINT CONFIGURATION.

	-big MTU (~>3712 bytes) cause a lot of "page allocation failure" error,
	 which impairs network performance (NFS at least)

	-nfs generates a lot of "received packet spanning multiple descriptors"
	 errors when MTU is not the same on both hosts!

	-partition sizes are not uniformly reported. Sometimes are binary based,
	 others decimal based.

	-component RAID disks hotpluging/ejecting might not do the right thing,
	 specially for raid0, JBD.

	-some web pages go back in browser history when an error is detected,
	 instead of reloading the previous page. The user must refresh the page

	-The Disk Partitioning web page is not able to re-partition disks whose
	 partitions that are not in increasing partition-start order, as the 
	 vendor's partition table are when configured for "standard disks".
	 This only happens if the user whish to keep some partition in the
	 middle of the disk unaltered. The solution is to re-partition the whole
	 disk, loosing all it data.
