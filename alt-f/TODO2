FIXED -fix OABI compatibility mode for the kernel.
	when starting a fresh build, the kernel configuration stored in
	local/dns323/linux- is processed by buildroot, and CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT
	is disabled!

-compile for speed.
	The default buildroot configuration is now -O2.
	As a result, available flash space is not enough anymore and some
	apps (ushare and transmission) were removed from the base system and
	added as a package. Also, ext2/3/4 are now kernel modules.
	Some packages redefine CFLAGS in their Makefile, thus buildroot configured
	default is lost (as it appears first in the compiler options list)
	This has to be done package by package.
	DONE -Samba needs it
	DONE -Kernel .config (don't compile for space)

DONE -URL in ipkg web page.
	Provide the source URL, so user can click it and see the
	package	homepage

DONE -Add ffp in ffp web package manager title

FIXED -Fix User services web page when there are no services available

DONT -Fix the /sbin/rc* shortcuts. They live in /Alt-F after a reboot.
	Remove before installing new ones. Is harmless.

-Fix the pkg-config and host-pkgconfig mess
	Read the package/pkg-config.mk comments
	Merge pkg-config and host-pkgconfig, with an option to create
	only on the host

HACKED -The start/stop services button should wait a little before returning, as
	some services takes some time to settle (transmission, e.g.)
	added a one second delay... too much for most services,
	too small for others (transmission)

FIXED -Remount /Alt-F with inotify during installing, etc, ipkg
	-packages_ipkg_proc.cgi 
	-create instead a ipkg wrapper? yes... ipkg calls ipkg-cl
	-but not for web page, sloow.

-Change Alt-F directory name to .Alt-F, to make it "invisible" to most users
	-or use the bind technique explained in aufs page?:

		hide=/tmp/.aufs.hide
		mkdir $hide
		mount -n --bind $hide /Alt-F

		When you unmount the aufs, delete/modify the branch by
		remount, or you want to show the hidden branches again,
		unmount the bound /tmp/.aufs.hide.

		umount -n /Alt-F
	-just call it .Alt-F

FIXED -Fix package_ipkg.cgi
	-is slooow
	-pkg names with a '-' are wrongly parsed (- is also the field separator)

-FIXED Fix package_ipkg_proc.cgi.
	-when installing ipkg, output is generated that makes a error page appear.

-fix "configfs" to handle the new packages files

-CUPS:
	DONE create user/group cups:lpadmin
	DONE fix /etc/mdev.conf to make /dev/lp* belong to lp:lp
	add conf file to cups package

FIXED -status.cgi, handle comments and cups additions in /etc/printcap

-long standing issue: sntp/ntpd will issue the following error with the first built:
	# sntp pt.pool.ntp.org
	sntp: can't resolve symbol '__aeabi_d2iz'
	
	this happens either with the stripped or non stripped binary.
	one must remove the binaries from the rootfs and source and rebuild
	the package. After that it works fine... build problem?

	-this also happens with package nano.

	The missing symbols are defined in /lib/libgcc_s.so.
	Why are they not used?! ld (/lib/ld-uClibc-0.9.30.3.so) problem?

	The problem is not the app, it seems to be in libm. It happens
	after the second make, as it seems to not make libraries in /lib
	correctly.


	******** FOR A RELEASE, ALWAYS DO A FRESH BUILD! ***************


-add -o owner:group option to "mkpkg.sh" so ipkg-build can use it to
	create the package files with another ownership


DONE -Add a don't cache passwd in the login/again page, as is done in the
	System Utilities->Change password

FIXED -After changing the host IP in the host setup page, it will not change

DONE -Sort the packages by name in ipkg web manager
	
-The DHCP udhcpc script /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script should do more
	configuration files and daemons signaling updates.
	It is already done in rcS, use it.
	FIXED -The script, at first boot, does not has a hostname.
	DONE -The host setup web page in DHCP mode also.


-iconv.h is removed from the stagging dir by buildroot! it says something
	like "removing iconv.h as locale is not defined".
	It comes from uClibc
	$BLDDIR/toolchain_build_arm/uClibc-0.9.30.3/Makefile.in
	as UCLIBC_HAS_XLOCALE is not defined, iconv.h is removed, even if
	it is not from uClibc.
	Note that this happens on the *second* initial build, not the first!
	(this is do a "make -O=...", followed for a second one)
	No solution? Patch this? hmmm
	Created a uClibc-0.9.30.3-iconv-h.patch, put in toolchain/uClibc lets see...

DONE -Add a configure button for each inetd service
	(dropped when splited inetd from network services)

-fix disk-proc.cgi:
	-if changing filesystem type from/to ext to vfat/ntfs or
	 vice-versa, the partition type must be changed too
	-also, fstab must be flushed, as labels/partition might have changed

FIXED -lpstat: Connection refused in web status page, when cups is not running

DONE -change name of ipkg to Alt-F in package manager web pages

DONE -add some feedback when downloading ipkg packages

DONE -show error status if ipkg fails for some reason

-read aufsutils carefully, to see if they are needed.
	Alt-F has already used them, but currently not

-The disk maker name does not appear in Disc Utilities (but appears in Status)

-ipkg frontend, aufs.sh, packages_ipkg_proc.cgi and hot.sh needs to be
	fixed. Each one of them mounts/create /Alt-F in its own way!
	-aufs.sh install should be called by ipkg -install
	-aufs.sh inotify/reval be called before/afters ipkg calls ipkg-cl
	-aufs.sh mount/umount be called by hot.sh
	-ipkg -install be called by packages_ipkg_proc.cgi install
	-aufs.sh be called by packages_ipkg_proc.cgi

FIXED -host.cgi/host_proc.cgi: there is a bug when changing workgroup. The
	new workgroup becomes "oldwk" which is the name of a hidden
	input form... it seems to only hapens the *first* time it is changed
	

DONE -ipkg:	web manager only supports one feed!

-nfs not working: MTU must be the same on both hosts! or else the msg
	received packet spanning multiple descriptors
	
-big MTU (>3712) generate lots of "page allocation failure", which impair the
	performance

FIXED -web login does not work if date is incorrect and timezone has been set
	If the box time is ahead of the real time, the web cookie expiration
	date is always expired... better to remove the cookie expiration date

-when RAID is recovering/syncing, sysctrl is continuously reporting
	a disk wakeup.

DONE -The "eject" script should have a status output, indicating if the device is
	or is not ejected.
	This would be used by the "Disk Maintenance" web page to change the
	"Eject" to a "Load" button.
	-now has the "-s" option

-"Disk Maintenance" web page should have a StandbyNow/WakeupNow button,
	(and removing the power status label?)

DONE -create tmpfs with more space; some packages are too big to fit the
	default 30MB while downloading.
	-now uses 64MB, (assume that disk swap is active...)

-cups uses a huge amount of memory in /tmp/cache.
	See how to make cups use the disk

FIXED -when installing some packages /etc/passwd et all are changed.
	If the user does not save settings in  flash afterwards, those
	users/groups are lost.
	They should be in /alt-F/etc/passwd et all, so when installing Alt-F
	they should reappear, but NO, the box settings take effect, as
	loadsave-setting from-alt-f is run when /Alt-F is mounted.
	-- Remember, the identity is in the box flash, not on the disk. --
	-In all web pages the user is warned to save settings, if needed to

DONE -foomatic-filters: beh should be removed from the package, as it is perl based

DONE -Add start short/long smart disk test to disk utils

DONE -merge /etc/tune.conf and /etc/hdsleep.conf into /etc/misc.conf

-check --spare-devices usage in diskpart and diskwizard with raid1, raid5

DONE -do a mdadm --scan at diskpart/diskwiz end to regenerate /etc/mdadm.comf

-set disk sleep timeout in rcS, as settings are not yet loaded at start when
 hotplugging disks.

-fix sysctrl to not show "xx disk wakeup" messages when mdadm is rebuilding raid
